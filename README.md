🎮 Simon Says – Virtual JavaScript Game

This is a mini JavaScript-based Simon Says virtual game, designed as a response and memory game that can be played on any device. The goal is to remember and repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors as the game progresses.

🕹️ How to Play

1-Start the game by pressing any key on your keyboard.

2-At each level, a new color blinks on the screen.

3-You must click the colors in the exact sequence, starting from the first level up to the current one.

4-With every level, the sequence gets longer, testing your memory and focus.

5-The game is infinite—it continues until you make a wrong selection.

6-Once you lose, your score and the highest score achieved will be displayed on the screen.

7-You can restart the game anytime by pressing any key again.

8-Refreshing the page will completely reset the game:
  -The game restarts from Level 0.
  -The highest score will also reset to 0, as it is not stored permanently.

✨ Challenge yourself to beat your high score and improve your memory skills!

Thanks for playing! 😊
