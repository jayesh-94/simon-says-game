🎮 Simon Says – Virtual JavaScript Game

This is a mini JavaScript-based Simon Says virtual game, designed as a response and memory game that can be played on any device. The goal is to remember and repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors as the game progresses.

🕹️ How to Play

Start the game by pressing any key on your keyboard.

At each level, a new color blinks on the screen.

You must click the colors in the exact sequence, starting from the first level up to the current one.

With every level, the sequence gets longer, testing your memory and focus.

The game is infinite—it continues until you make a wrong selection.

Once you lose, your score and the highest score achieved will be displayed on the screen.

You can restart the game anytime by pressing any key again.

✨ Challenge yourself to beat your high score and improve your memory skills!

Thanks for playing! 😊
